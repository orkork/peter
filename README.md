# peter

peter is a simple keyword research tool.

I started peter as a nodejs learning project for myself after reading an article named ["Web Scraping With Node.js" on Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/08/web-scraping-with-nodejs/), especially the part about data mining.
Starting with that basic idea, I want to implement an easy to use tool for keyword researching. While I use the original code as a starting point, there will barely be anything left of it after a short time.

## Dev notes

If you are interrested: I will keep some notes about the development of peter on my german blog [orkork.de](http://www.orkork.de/development/peter-ein-keyword-research-tool-mit-nodejs/).
